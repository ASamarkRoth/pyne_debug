# Tentative indicator

I have been using the ENSDF reader in my PhD work on the nuclear structure of alpha decaying nuclei. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to PyNE developers for a great python tool. 

During the work, I made some slight modifications to the source code to include angular momentum and parity of the parent and children states for alpha decays, as these are main ingredients in the theoretical models. The spin and parity are bunched together in a notation as '7/2+', where '7/2' is the spin and '+' is the parity of the state. Many of the existing states have been assigned tentative spin and/or parity and these are enclosed within parentheses. Why important?
